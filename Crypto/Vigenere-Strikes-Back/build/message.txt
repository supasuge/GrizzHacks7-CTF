Dearest friend,

I hope this missive finds you in good health, good beer, and high spirits. The days have grown long and the nights even longer as we toil under the watchful eyes of our superiors. The work is arduous, tedious, and boring, but we find solace in the almighty QuackLord.

The fields are ripe with the fruits of our labor, and soon we shall reap the rewards. The harvest festival is upon us, and the village is abuzz with preparations. The air is filled with the scent of freshly baked bread and the sound of laughter echoes through the streets.


For now please take this flag as a token of your hard work: GRIZZCTFVIGENERESTRIKESAGAINFLAG

I long for the days when we can sit by the fire and share stories of our adventures. Until then, I remain ever your faithful to the almighty QuackLord.

Yours truly,
A Fellow Vigenere Enthusiast
