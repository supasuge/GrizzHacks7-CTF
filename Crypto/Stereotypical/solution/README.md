# Stereotypical

## Introduction

This challenge presents a relatively common RSA challenge in which you are give `n`, `e`, `ct` as well as part of the known plaintext, with an exception to the inner part of the flag in between `{` and `}`.

By change X to null-byte, we can create our formula:

$f = (msg + x)^{e} â€” c$

And apply Coppersmith:
```python
sage: P.<x> = PolynomialRing(Zmod(n))
sage: f = (msg + x)^e - c
sage: f = f.monic()
sage: m = f.small_roots(epsilon=1/20)
sage: hex(int(m[0]))[2:-1].decode()
```
