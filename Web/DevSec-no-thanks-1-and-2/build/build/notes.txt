SECURITY AUDIT FINDINGS - URGENT
--------------------------------
DATE: 2023-10-25
AUDITOR: Michael Chen, Security Lead

CRITICAL ISSUES:
1. Python3 binary has SUID bit set! This is a SEVERE security risk as it allows
   privilege escalation. Check with:
   > find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
   
   This needs to be fixed IMMEDIATELY in production environment.
   
2. Restricted shell configuration for ctfuser is incomplete.
   Users may be able to break out of the restricted environment.

3. SSH keys are not being used - password authentication is enabled.

SYSTEM MAINTENANCE TASKS:
------------------------
- Update nginx configuration for security hardening
- Implement proper access controls for admin area
- Remove development credentials from publicly accessible directories
- Disable directory listing in nginx configuration
- Fix file permissions throughout the system

BACKUP SCHEDULE:
---------------
- Daily incremental backups stored in /backup
- Weekly full backups to offsite storage
- Monthly system configuration backup

COMMANDS FOR REFERENCE:
---------------------
- Check for SUID binaries: find / -type f -perm -u=s -ls 2>/dev/null
- Verify user permissions: ls -la /home/ctfuser/
- Check system services: systemctl status
